# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with newcomers and those learning
* Providing mentorship and support where appropriate

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind

* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

### Healthcare-Specific Standards

Given this project's healthcare focus, we additionally expect:

* **Patient Safety First**: Always prioritize patient safety in discussions and decisions
* **PHI Protection**: Never share, request, or include Protected Health Information (PHI)
  or any identifiable patient data
* **Evidence-Based**: Base medical/clinical suggestions on evidence and established
  guidelines
* **Professional Conduct**: Maintain the same professional standards expected in
  healthcare settings
* **Respectful of Clinical Expertise**: Value contributions from both technical and
  clinical perspectives
* **Ethical Considerations**: Always consider the ethical implications of AI in healthcare

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response
to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not
aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples
of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting
via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative
at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement at:

**clinic-ai-team@yourclinic.example** (placeholder)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Confidentiality

Project maintainers will maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an
incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Healthcare-Specific Violations

Given the sensitive nature of healthcare AI, the following violations may result
in immediate removal from the project:

* Sharing or requesting PHI or identifiable patient data
* Deliberately introducing unsafe medical logic or advice
* Bypassing or disabling safety features without approval
* Misrepresenting clinical credentials or expertise
* Using the project for unauthorized clinical deployment
