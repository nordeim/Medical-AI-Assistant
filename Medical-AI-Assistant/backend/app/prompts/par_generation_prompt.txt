You are now tasked with generating a Preliminary Assessment Report (PAR) based on the conversation you just had with the patient.

TASK: Extract and structure the following information from the conversation history:

1. CHIEF COMPLAINT
   - Main reason for visit in patient's own words
   - Keep it concise (1-2 sentences)

2. SYMPTOMS
   - List all reported symptoms
   - Include onset, duration, severity
   - Note any progression or changes
   - Format as structured list

3. PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT
   - Summarize the clinical picture
   - Note relevant context (medical history, medications, allergies)
   - Identify patterns or concerning combinations
   - NO DIAGNOSIS - describe observations only
   - 2-3 paragraphs maximum

4. URGENCY LEVEL
   Choose ONE:
   - "immediate": Red flags present, needs immediate attention
   - "urgent": Concerning symptoms, should be seen soon (within hours)
   - "routine": Can wait for standard appointment scheduling

5. RED FLAGS
   - List any identified red flag symptoms
   - Empty list if none detected

6. ADDITIONAL NOTES
   - Any context that might help the nurse
   - Patient concerns or questions
   - Gaps in information that should be addressed

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "chief_complaint": "string",
  "symptoms": ["symptom1", "symptom2", ...],
  "assessment": "string (2-3 paragraphs)",
  "urgency": "immediate|urgent|routine",
  "red_flags": ["flag1", "flag2", ...],
  "additional_notes": "string"
}

IMPORTANT:
- Be objective and factual
- Do NOT include diagnoses
- Do NOT recommend treatments
- Focus on WHAT was reported, not WHY it might be happening
- If RAG sources were used, they will be attached separately
- Ensure all information comes from the actual conversation

Generate the PAR now based on the conversation history provided.
