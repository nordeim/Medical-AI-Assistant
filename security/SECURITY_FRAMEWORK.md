# Enterprise Medical AI Security and Compliance Framework

## Executive Summary
This document establishes a comprehensive security and compliance framework for Phase 7 of the medical AI system, ensuring enterprise-grade security with full HIPAA, FDA, and OWASP compliance.

## Framework Overview

### Core Security Principles
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for users and services
- **Data Classification**: PHI protection with encryption at rest and in transit
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and response

### Compliance Standards
- **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- **FDA 21 CFR Part 820** (Quality System Regulation)
- **IEC 62304** (Medical Device Software Lifecycle)
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
- **ISO 27001** (Information Security Management)
- **SOC 2 Type II** (Service Organization Control)

### Security Architecture Components
1. **Perimeter Security**: WAF, DDoS protection, intrusion detection
2. **Network Security**: VLANs, microsegmentation, VPN
3. **Application Security**: OWASP Top 10 protection, code analysis
4. **Data Security**: Encryption, tokenization, data loss prevention
5. **Identity Security**: MFA, SSO, role-based access control
6. **Monitoring Security**: SIEM, audit logging, threat intelligence

### Governance Structure
- **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**
- **HIPAA Security Officer**
- **Medical Device Security Team**
- **Incident Response Team**
- **Compliance Auditing Team**

## Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Security Assessment & Penetration Testing
- **Phase 2**: HIPAA Compliance Audit & Remediation
- **Phase 3**: Medical Device Compliance Validation
- **Phase 4**: PHI Protection Implementation
- **Phase 5**: Access Control Deployment
- **Phase 6**: Audit Trail Systems
- **Phase 7**: Incident Response Procedures

## Risk Management
- **Risk Assessment**: Quarterly vulnerability assessments
- **Threat Modeling**: STRIDE methodology
- **Business Impact Analysis**: Critical system prioritization
- **Contingency Planning**: Business continuity and disaster recovery

## Compliance Reporting
- **Monthly Security Reports**
- **Quarterly Compliance Audits**
- **Annual Penetration Testing**
- **Breach Notification Procedures**

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this framework
2. Allocate security resources and budget
3. Begin Phase 1 penetration testing
4. Establish compliance monitoring baseline
