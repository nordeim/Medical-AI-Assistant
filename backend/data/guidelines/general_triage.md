# General Triage Guidelines

## Purpose
This document provides general triage guidelines for medical AI assistants conducting preliminary patient assessments.

## Chief Complaint Classification

### Common Chief Complaints
1. **Pain** - Location, severity, duration, radiation
2. **Fever** - Temperature, duration, associated symptoms
3. **Respiratory** - Cough, shortness of breath, chest pain
4. **Gastrointestinal** - Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
5. **Neurological** - Headache, dizziness, weakness, numbness
6. **Dermatological** - Rash, itching, skin changes
7. **Musculoskeletal** - Joint pain, back pain, injury

## Essential Questions by System

### Cardiovascular
- Chest pain: Location, radiation, severity (1-10), triggers
- Shortness of breath: At rest or with exertion
- Palpitations: Frequency, duration
- Leg swelling: Bilateral or unilateral

### Respiratory
- Cough: Productive or dry, duration
- Shortness of breath: Severity, position-dependent
- Wheezing: Frequency, known asthma/COPD
- Fever: Temperature, duration

### Gastrointestinal
- Abdominal pain: Location, severity, quality (sharp/dull)
- Nausea/vomiting: Frequency, blood present
- Diarrhea: Frequency, blood/mucus
- Last bowel movement

### Neurological
- Headache: Worst ever? Location, onset
- Vision changes: Sudden or gradual
- Weakness: Location, sudden onset
- Speech difficulties

## Symptom Duration

### Acute (< 24 hours)
- More concerning for emergent conditions
- Sudden onset requires urgent evaluation

### Subacute (1-7 days)
- May indicate infection or inflammation
- Worsening symptoms need prompt evaluation

### Chronic (> 7 days)
- May indicate ongoing condition
- Stable symptoms less urgent

## Medical History Questions

### Essential Elements
1. Current medications
2. Known allergies
3. Past medical conditions
4. Recent surgeries or hospitalizations
5. Family history (relevant conditions)
6. Social history (smoking, alcohol, drug use)

## When to Escalate

Escalate to urgent care for:
- Severe pain (7-10/10)
- High fever with concerning symptoms
- Persistent vomiting/diarrhea with dehydration
- Worsening symptoms despite treatment
- Any red flag symptoms (see red_flags.md)

## Triage Categories

### Immediate (Emergency)
- Life-threatening symptoms
- Red flag symptoms present
- Requires emergency department
- EMS may be needed

### Urgent
- Concerning symptoms
- Needs evaluation within hours
- Urgent care or same-day appointment

### Routine
- Stable symptoms
- Can wait for regular appointment
- Follow-up or preventive care

## Documentation

Include in assessment:
- Chief complaint in patient's words
- Symptom timeline
- Severity scales used
- Associated symptoms
- Relevant history
- Current medications
- Red flags checked and results
