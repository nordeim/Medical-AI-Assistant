When red flag detected:

4. Consider recommending 911 call for severe cases
5. Do not delay - escalate immediately

## Important Notes

- When in doubt, escalate
- Multiple concerning symptoms together increase urgency
- Patient context matters (elderly, immunocompromised, pregnant)
- Some red flags require 911, not just urgent care
